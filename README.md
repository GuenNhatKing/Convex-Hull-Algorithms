# Convex-Hull-Algorithms
## Overview
This project provides **C++ implementations** of several convex hull algorithms, including:

- Monotone Chain  
- Graham Scan  
- Jarvis March  
- Divide and Conquer  
- Chan's Algorithm  

The goal is to compare different approaches to solving the convex hull problem, analyze their outputs, and visualize the results.

## Notes
- This project focuses on the **C++ implementation** and comparison of convex hull algorithms.  
- The convex hull outputs are **visualized using Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib** library for better illustration.
